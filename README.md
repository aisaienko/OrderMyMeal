Order My Meal app is a local app which can be used by PA local community to simplify the process of ordering a meal from Meals Direct service

The app helps to choose the products from available menu and calculate number of unit used. It also generates a text which can be used to send SMS to order the meal.

This is open source app so feel free to submit a pull request to make changes.
